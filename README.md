# slackbot-eliza

This is a [slackbot](https://github.com/lins05/slackbot) plugin that implements a
very simple version of the ["Eliza"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) program.

This implementation is wholly based on
[one shared by Evan Dempsey @ SmallSureThing](https://www.smallsurething.com/implementing-the-famous-eliza-chatbot-in-python/)
which is in turn
[based on an earlier implementation](http://www.jezuk.co.uk/cgi-bin/view/software/eliza).
They are pretty simple implementations, so they will not pass any turing tests.

But it makes a more amusing default reply than, "I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that!"
